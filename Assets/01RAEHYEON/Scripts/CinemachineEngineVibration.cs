/// <summary>
/// Adds a small engine-idle vibration to a Cinemachine camera.
///
/// This runs as a Cinemachine extension rather than a plain MonoBehaviour: Cinemachine
/// writes the camera transform every frame, so shaking the Transform directly would be
/// overwritten. Here the shake is added at the Finalize stage, after everything else.
///
/// Two layers are summed:
///   - Engine:  high frequency, tiny amplitude. The buzz you feel through the seat.
///   - Chassis: low frequency, slightly larger. The body rocking on its suspension.
/// A single frequency alone reads as a mechanical buzz, so the slow layer is what makes
/// it feel like an engine instead of a vibrating prop.
///
/// Rotation is what the eye actually notices; position does very little on its own.
/// Defaults are tuned for this project's cars (root scale ~3.6).
